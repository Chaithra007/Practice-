You are given two strings s and t. In one step, you can append any character to either s or t.

Return the minimum number of steps to make s and t anagrams of each other.

An anagram of a string is a string that contains the same characters with a different (or the same) ordering.

```
Input: s = "leetcode", t = "coats"
Output: 7
Explanation: 
- In 2 steps, we can append the letters in "as" onto s = "leetcode", forming s = "leetcodeas".
- In 5 steps, we can append the letters in "leede" onto t = "coats", forming t = "coatsleede".
"leetcodeas" and "coatsleede" are now anagrams of each other.
We used a total of 2 + 5 = 7 steps.
It can be shown that there is no way to make them anagrams of each other with less than 7 steps.
```

CODE
```
int minSteps(string s, string t) {
        unordered_map<char,int> sana;
        unordered_map<char,int> tana;
        int n=s.size();
        int m=t.size();
        for(int i=0;i<n;i++)
        {
            sana[s[i]]++;
        }
        for(int i=0;i<m;i++)
        {
            tana[t[i]]++;
        }
        for(int i=0;i<n;i++)
        {
            if(tana.find(s[i])!=tana.end())
            {
                tana[s[i]]--;
                sana[s[i]]--;
            }
        }
        int count=0;
        for(auto x:tana)
        {
            
                count+=abs(x.second);
            
        }
        for(auto x:sana)
        {
            
                count+=abs(x.second);
            
        }
        return count;

    }
```

** DESCRIPTION **
 Straight forward solution make use of hashmaps to store the count of all the characters in the string . 

Then traverse through the string s and reduce the count of the character in both the hshmaps if it is found in t string hashmap 

then count the absolute value of both the hashmap
